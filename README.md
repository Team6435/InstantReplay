Walk-with-me is a small app which enables you to take virtual long walks with
your friends. You choose a route you want to walk, create a map (the current map takes you from Rocky Point on Long Island to LEGOLand in Carlsbad Ca) and enter the distance you and your friends have hiked on a regular basis. The app will keep track of your progress and show a map with your current location on this virtual hike.


# Install Walk-with-me


Get python from app store (or download installer from python website), use pip to install needed packages. First upgrade pip
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then you need to install the following packages using pip (just type what you see here). The packages also install their dependencies (which is sometimes a lot):
```
pip install googlemaps
pip install polyline
pip install geopy
pip install gmaps
pip install wheel
pip install matplotlib
```

You will need to get a google maps API key for this to work. They are available free of charge from Google.
